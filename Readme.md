# How to traverse through all nodes in TreeList


<p>This example demonstrates how the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraTreeListTreeList_NodesIteratortopic">NodesIterator</a> object can be used to traverse through all existing nodes. </p><p><i>Please note that when the TreeList works in virtual mode, child nodes are created only when an end-user expands a parent node. Until this, these nodes are not created and that is why they cannot be obtained.</i></p>
